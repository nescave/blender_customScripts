## Blender Custom Scripts
Small showcase of blender automation scripts i created during my work on previous projects

### Custom Pivot Paint Tool
My team needed a simple yet efficient way of animating hundreds of small debris on a scene. I created shader in UE4 that used vertex animation to float and rotate them around and then i had to also make this blender script that will create data i needed on specific channels i wanted. Final product needed to work on VR mobile device so it had to be heavily optimized.

### UV Tools
Blender lacks decent tools to operate on multiple objects's Uvs at the same time. I was tasked with managing hundreds of 3D assets provided by our art team. Models had to have two uv sets (base and light map) and had to have their textures rebaked on a global atlas. I made few smaller scripts that saved me few thousads clicks
