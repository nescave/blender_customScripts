## Blender Custom Scripts
Small showcase of blender automation scripts i created during my work on previous projects

### Custom Pivot Paint Tool
My team needed a simple yet efficient way of animating hundreds of small debris on a scene. I created shader in UE4 that used vertex animation to float and rotate them around and then i had to also make this blender script that will create data i needed on specific channels i wanted. Final product needed to work on VR mobile device so it had to be heavily optimized.
